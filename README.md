# Outcome - Flight Prediction Market on Mantle

Outcome is a decentralized flight prediction market built on the Mantle network. It allows users to speculate on flight outcomes (e.g., delays, cancellations) using a transparent and trustless blockchain infrastructure, enhanced by institutional-grade AI analysis.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Prediction Markets**: Participate in decentralized markets for flight arrival status.
*   **AI Risk Assessment**: Integrated Llama 3.1 analysis via **Groq** for real-time trading signals and flight risk reports.
*   **Real-time Aviation Data**: Automated flight tracking and market initialization powered by the **AviationStack API**.
*   **Hybrid AMM**: Sophisticated Logarithmic Market Scoring Rule (LMSR) for liquidity pricing, paired with a fair cost-based payout mechanism.
*   **Mantle Network**: High-performance, low-fee trading secured by Ethereum.
*   **Connect with Ease**: Seamless wallet integration via **Particle Network**, supporting both social and traditional EOA logins.
